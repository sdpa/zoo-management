# Getting Started with Zoo App

1. Have nodejs installed on your system
2. cd into "zoo-management" folder and run "npm install" in this directory
3. also run "npm i @date-io/date-fns@1.3.13" because there's a weird dependency issue with this library where it has to be this version
4. From here you should be able to start up the front end by running "npm start"
5. In another terminal you can run the command "npm run server" in order to start up the back end (if you don't do this step you will not have access to the database)

That should be all the steps required to run our project.
